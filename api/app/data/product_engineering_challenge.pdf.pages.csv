Page 1,"5/11/23, 11:42AM Product engineering challenge ❔ Product engineering challenge We've created this challenge to resemble the day-to-day work you'd be doing at Gumroad. It should take roughly 6-16 hours. Please submit your answers by emailing them to sahil@gumroad.com in a new thread (please self-host + share the source code with us via a public-but-obscure GitHub repository). Rebuildaskmybook.com in Rails and React. Must-dos include: • Script to format PDF manuscript as local data file with embeddings • Text box to receive question • Back-end that: fetches most relevant embeddings using local data file ◦ ◦ caches answers, otherwise hits OpenAI for answer Front-end that displays answer • A good response shows off your ability to: • Understand existing code • Read through API docs • Create a new Rails project • Install and use React within it https://gumroad.notion.site/Product-engineering-challenge-f7aa85150edd41eeb3537aae4632619f 1/2",202
Page 2,"5/11/23, 11:42AM Product engineering challenge • Coding! Currently, the project relies on a few Python libraries. Find Ruby equivalents or rewrite the code such that they are no longer required (this should be possible by keeping the content and embeddings that index them in one file, instead of across two). Notes • Please structure your commits so that they're easily understandable Automated tests are encouraged but not required • • Explain a couple of the big architectural decisions you've made, and anything you learned/would do differently the next time around https://gumroad.notion.site/Product-engineering-challenge-f7aa85150edd41eeb3537aae4632619f 2/2",133
